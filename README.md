# The Edge Story

*🚧 **WORK IN PROGRESS** - Transmedia storytelling universe in development*

## Current Status: TBD

**🌌 Live Site**: https://theedgestory.org

A 13-year journey from a girl's question about green sky to a transmedia storytelling platform. Combining comics, games, and collaborative narrative in a world where the sky is green.

## Project Overview

The Edge Story is a transmedia storytelling universe that began in 2011 with one simple question: "Why is the sky blue and not green?" This question sparked a multi-universe narrative spanning from alternative reality to post-apocalyptic future through:

- 📚 **Comics** - Published and distributed
- 🎮 **Games** - Interactive narrative experiences
- 🤝 **Collaborative Storytelling** - Real-time multi-player narrative platform
- 🌍 **Multi-Universe** - Stories across different timelines and realities

## Current Development

We are building a transmedia multi-co-game-rpg platform that spans from our days in alternative reality to days where everything collapses, ending with a story about the last surviving girl who becomes the beginning.

*The first step is always a comic :)*
